## Motivation

After an academic year with the trouble of finding reviews about our necessary modules, struggling to assess professors' teaching quality, and facing difficulties in setting up an academic plan, we were motivated to enhance the academic journey for students at the National University of Singapore (NUS). We aimed to create a platform tailored to their unique needs, enabling them to share and access evaluations of professors and courses easily. By incorporating user authentication to ensure trustworthiness and a feature for personalized schedule recommendations to aid in academic planning, our goal is to empower students with the tools they need to make informed decisions, improve their educational experience, and foster a supportive, engaged academic community.

## User Stories

In the envisioned system, students are empowered to navigate their academic journey with greater insight and personalization. They will be able to delve into detailed reviews and ratings of professors and courses, enabling informed decision-making tailored to individual learning preferences and goals. Beyond consuming content, students can contribute their own experiences, rating educational aspects like clarity and engagement to aid their peers. The system offers a personalized schedule recommendation tool where students input preferences to generate optimal academic schedules, further enhancing this by sharing and soliciting feedback on these schedules within the community. Secure user authentication ensures a personalized and safe experience, encouraging a vibrant exchange of knowledge. Students can also compare courses and professors through filters, engage in discussions, and connect over shared academic interests, creating a collaborative and informed community eager to support each otherâ€™s academic success.
